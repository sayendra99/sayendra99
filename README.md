### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Growing up I was always interested in the sciences and technology. In high school, I excelled in math and science classes, which led me to pursue a degree in engineering. I went on to earn my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Engineering and am currently working on my Masterâ€™s in Computer Science  Engineering. After I finish my degree, I plan to use my knowledge to help improve technology  in developing countries.
